- **Quick Environment Switching** - Easily switch between environments from the toolbar dropdown

### 📜 Scripts

- **Pre-Request Script** - Run JavaScript before a request is sent to dynamically modify request data or set variables
- **Post-Request Script** - Run JavaScript after a response is received to write assertions or process response data
- **Script Snippets** - Built-in snippet panel for common scripting patterns (both pre- and post-request)
- **Script Output** - View console output and errors from scripts directly in the response panel

### 💻 Code Generation

Generate ready-to-use code snippets for the current request in multiple languages:

| Language | Library |
|----------|---------|
| cURL | - |
| JavaScript | `fetch` |
| Python | `requests` |
| Java | `HttpClient` |
| C# / .NET | `HttpClient` |
| Go | `net/http` |
| Rust | `reqwest` |
| C++ | `libcurl` |

Variables in the request are resolved before generating the snippet.

### 🗂️ OpenAPI Editor

- **In-App Editor** - Edit OpenAPI specifications directly inside Fetchy with full syntax highlighting (YAML & JSON)
- **Import to Collection** - Convert an OpenAPI spec into a Fetchy collection in one click

### 🗃️ Workspaces

- **Multiple Workspaces** - Create separate workspaces for different projects or clients
- **Separate Storage Directories** - Each workspace has its own home directory (collections, environments) and secrets directory (secret variable values)
- **Switch Workspaces** - Switch between workspaces; the app reloads with the selected workspace's data
- **Export & Import Workspaces** - Back up and restore a full workspace to/from a single JSON file
- **Workspace Management** - Add, rename, remove, export, and import workspaces from the Settings panel

### ⌨️ Keyboard Shortcuts

| Shortcut | Action |
|----------|--------|
| `Ctrl+S` | Save current request |
| `Ctrl+Enter` | Send request |
| `Ctrl+N` | New request |
| `Ctrl+W` | Close current tab |
| `Ctrl+Tab` | Next tab |
| `Ctrl+Shift+Tab` | Previous tab |
| `Ctrl+1-9` | Switch to tab 1-9 |
| `Ctrl+I` | Import collection |
| `Ctrl+E` | Open environments |
| `Ctrl+/` | Show keyboard shortcuts |

- **Panel Layout** - Switch the response panel between a side-by-side (horizontal) and top-bottom (vertical) layout
- **Resizable Panels** - Drag to resize the sidebar and request/response panels
- **Collapsible Sidebar** - Hide the sidebar to maximize the working area
- **Syntax Highlighting** - JSON and code highlighting powered by CodeMirror 6

- **Panel Layout** - Configure whether the response panel appears to the right or below the request panel
- **Workspace Management** - Switch, create, export, and import workspaces

### 💾 Data Storage

- **Workspace-Based Storage** - Each workspace stores its data in a chosen directory on your filesystem
- **Separate Secrets Directory** - Secret variable values are stored in a dedicated directory, separate from the rest of the workspace data
- **JSON Storage** - All data is stored as human-readable JSON files
- **Automatic Persistence** - Changes are saved automatically (when auto-save is enabled)

3. Enter your API endpoint URL
4. Select the HTTP method
5. Add headers, parameters, or body as needed
6. Click **Send** or press `Ctrl+Enter`

### Using Environment Variables

1. Open the Environment modal (`Ctrl+E`)
2. Create a new environment
3. Add variables (e.g., `base_url`, `api_key`)
4. Use variables in your requests: `<<base_url>>/api/users`
5. Variables are highlighted in green when defined, yellow when undefined
6. Switch environments using the dropdown in the top toolbar

### Organizing with Collections

1. Create a collection for your project
2. Add folders for different API modules
3. Drag and drop to organize requests, folders, and collections
4. Set collection-level auth to apply to all child requests
5. Define collection variables for values shared across all requests

### Running a Collection

1. Right-click a collection in the sidebar and choose **Run Collection**
2. Configure the run mode (sequential or parallel), delay, iterations, and stop-on-error behaviour
3. Click **Run** to execute all requests and view per-request results

### Using Scripts

1. Open a request and select the **Pre-Script** or **Script** tab
2. Write JavaScript code; use the built-in snippet panel for common patterns
3. Script output and errors appear in the **Console** tab of the response panel after the request is sent

### Generating Code Snippets

1. Open a request
2. Click the **Code** button (or the arrow next to it to pick a language)
3. Copy the generated snippet for cURL, JavaScript, Python, Java, C#, Go, Rust, or C++
